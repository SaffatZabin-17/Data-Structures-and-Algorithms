1) This list ADT implementation consists of two parts. One is implementing the List ADT as Array. Another

   one is implemeting it as a LinkedList

2) The file Arr.JAVA contains the source code for ArrayList implementation.

3) The file LL.JAVA contains the source code for LinkedList implementation.

4) The file Main.JAVA contains the sample code for output for some sample input

5) The file TNL.JAVA contains the TNL implementation

6) The file List.JAVA is an interface, which contains the 13 methods that were implemented by both the

   Arr.JAVA and LL.JAVA files

7) The operations include constructors which initialize the ArrayList/LinkedList either as empty, or with

   an array and some other variables. Other operations include inserting an item in the current position,

   appending an item, removing an item, setting the current position to the beginning of the list, getting

   the length of the list etc.
